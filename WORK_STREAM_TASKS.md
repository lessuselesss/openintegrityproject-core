# Open Integrity Project: Work Stream Tasks

This document tracks tasks across multiple work streams (branches) for the Open Integrity Project. It serves as the single source of truth for project status and planning.

## Work Stream Management Strategy

To maintain this document's integrity while supporting parallel development, follow these guidelines:

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - This document in `main` is the official record of all work streams
   - Each task is tagged with its branch name in square brackets: `[branch-name]`
   - Only update your branch's sections, leave other sections intact

2. **Status Updates**
   - When making significant progress in a branch, update this document with status
   - Create a small, focused PR to update just your branch's tasks in this document
   - Keep documentation changes separate from code changes where possible

3. **Branch Creation Process**
   - When creating a new branch, add a new section to this document
   - Follow the existing format: branch name, description, and priority levels
   - Tag all tasks with the branch name in square brackets

4. **Completion Updates**
   - When a task is completed, mark it as done and add the completion date
   - Move completed tasks to the "Completed" section under your branch
   - Final branch PR should include the completed status in this document

This approach keeps all status information in one place while clearly assigning ownership of tasks to specific branches.
