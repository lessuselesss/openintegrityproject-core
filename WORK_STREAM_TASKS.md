# Open Integrity Project: Work Stream Tasks

This document tracks tasks across multiple work streams (branches) for the Open Integrity Project. It serves as the single source of truth for project status and planning.

## Work Stream Management Strategy

To maintain this document's integrity while supporting parallel development, follow these guidelines:

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - This document in `main` is the official record of all work streams
   - Each task is tagged with its branch name in square brackets: `[branch-name]`
   - Only update your branch's sections, leave other sections intact

2. **Status Updates**
   - When making significant progress in a branch, update this document with status
   - Create a small, focused PR to update just your branch's tasks in this document
   - Keep documentation changes separate from code changes where possible

3. **Branch Creation Process**
   - When creating a new branch, add a new section to this document
   - Follow the existing format: branch name, description, and priority levels
   - Tag all tasks with the branch name in square brackets

4. **Completion Updates**
   - When a task is completed, mark it as done and add the completion date
   - Move completed tasks to the "Completed" section under your branch
   - Final branch PR should include the completed status in this document

This approach keeps all status information in one place while clearly assigning ownership of tasks to specific branches.

## Branch: [feature/verified-work-streams]

Implementation of cryptographically verifiable work stream management with structured data formats and automated validation.

**Related Issues:**
- [ISSUES-Open_Integrity_Scripting_Infrastructure.md: Automated Work Stream Workflow Enforcement](src/issues/ISSUES-Open_Integrity_Scripting_Infrastructure.md)
  > Addresses the need for platform-agnostic, cryptographically verifiable work stream tracking and PR dependency validation.

**Related Requirements:**
- Work stream management must be platform-independent (not tied to GitHub)
- Leverage cryptographic verification over platform trust
- Support automated validation without external dependencies
- Enable structured queries and programmatic enforcement

**Key Features to Explore:**
1. **Structured Data Format**: TOML/JSON/YAML for machine-readable work streams
2. **Cryptographic Verification**: Sign work stream data, verify PR dependencies
3. **Test Contract PR**: Intermediate PR defining function signatures/interfaces before implementation
4. **Automated Validation**: Platform-agnostic scripts for workflow enforcement

### Stage 1: Requirements & Design
- [ ] **Define structured work stream format** [feature/verified-work-streams]
  - [ ] Choose data format (TOML vs JSON vs YAML) based on readability and tooling
  - [ ] Design schema for branches, stages, tasks, PRs, and dependencies
  - [ ] Document cryptographic verification model for work stream data
  - [ ] Create REQUIREMENTS-verified_work_streams.md with complete specification

### Stage 2: PR Dependency Verification
- [ ] **Design cryptographic PR dependency model** [feature/verified-work-streams]
  - [ ] Define how status PRs cryptographically reference code PRs
  - [ ] Specify git commit hash references for PR dependencies
  - [ ] Document verification process for PR ordering and completeness
  - [ ] Explore test contract PR model (function signatures before implementation)

### Stage 3: Test Contract PR Model (Optional/Exploratory)
- [ ] **Evaluate intermediate test/contract PR approach** [feature/verified-work-streams]
  - [ ] Research benefits of defining interfaces before implementation
  - [ ] Design format for function signature contracts
  - [ ] Determine if contracts should be separate PR or part of status PR
  - [ ] Document pros/cons and make recommendation
  - [ ] Example: Status PR → Test Contract PR (function sigs) → Implementation PR

### Stage 4: Data Conversion Tools
- [ ] **Implement structured format tooling** [feature/verified-work-streams]
  - [ ] Create parser for structured work stream data (jq/yq/toml-cli)
  - [ ] Implement generator: structured data → WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md
  - [ ] Add validation script for schema compliance
  - [ ] Create src/generate_work_stream_docs.sh

### Stage 5: Validation Scripts
- [ ] **Build platform-agnostic validation** [feature/verified-work-streams]
  - [ ] Implement src/validate_work_stream.sh for workflow compliance
  - [ ] Add branch naming convention checks
  - [ ] Verify task tagging matches branch names
  - [ ] Check PR dependency ordering (status before code)
  - [ ] Validate cryptographic signatures on work stream data

### Stage 6: Git Hook Integration
- [ ] **Create pre-commit and pre-push hooks** [feature/verified-work-streams]
  - [ ] Add work stream data validation to pre-commit
  - [ ] Verify branch tags in commit messages
  - [ ] Check WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md consistency in pre-push
  - [ ] Document hook installation and configuration

### Stage 7: Documentation & Migration
- [ ] **Document system and migrate existing data** [feature/verified-work-streams]
  - [ ] Create comprehensive ISSUES-verified_work_streams.md
  - [ ] Write migration guide for existing work streams
  - [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new workflow documentation
  - [ ] Convert current WORK_STREAM_TASKS.md to structured format
  - [ ] Add examples and best practices guide

### Open Questions to Resolve
- [ ] **Data format selection** [feature/verified-work-streams]
  - TOML: Human-readable, good for config, native Rust support
  - JSON: Ubiquitous tooling (jq), but less readable
  - YAML: Most readable, but ambiguous spec
  - Decision criteria: Tooling availability, readability, unambiguous parsing

- [ ] **Test contract PR workflow** [feature/verified-work-streams]
  - Is an intermediate PR with function signatures valuable?
  - Should it be part of status PR or separate?
  - How does it integrate with cryptographic verification?
  - Does it add too much overhead for simple changes?

- [ ] **Cryptographic verification scope** [feature/verified-work-streams]
  - Sign entire work stream file or individual entries?
  - How to verify PR dependency chains cryptographically?
  - Integration with existing git signature requirements?
  - Can we cryptographically prove status PR preceded code PR?
